# react-apollo-testing
Code example for Testing GraphQL/React Applications

## About

This project shows how to get started with testing React applications that use GraphQL to retrieve and mutate data. It uses `apollo-boost` and `react-apollo` to handle GraphQL. For testing it uses `react-test-renderer` to render the components, `react-apollo/test-utils` to mock the GraphQL components and `easygraphql-tester` to directly test the GraphQL schema.

## Get started

To start the application
```
npm install
npm start
```

To run the tests:

```
npm test
```
